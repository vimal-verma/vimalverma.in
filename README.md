# Vimal's Interactive Portfolio

Welcome to my interactive portfolio built with Next.js! This project features a unique user experience with an interactive Robot Guide and a fully functional Terminal interface.

## Features

### 🤖 Interactive Robot Guide

- **Voice Interaction**: Uses Web Speech API to speak to visitors.
- **Expressions**: Dynamic facial expressions (happy, excited, sleepy, confused, love).
- **Mini-Game**: Catch falling energy bolts to charge the robot!
- **Interactive**: Follows mouse movement, reacts to clicks, and dances.

- **Commands**:
  - `help`: List available commands.
  - `about`, `projects`, `skills`, `experience`: Navigate to sections.
  - `game`: Start the mini-game.
  - `robot <expression>`: Change robot expressions.
  - `theme`: Toggle dark/light mode.
  - `message`: Send a contact message.
